# Scope Boundaries — What This Demo Is / Is Not

## What I DO
- Show end-to-end data plumbing for a fabrication workflow (synthetic CAM → ETL → warehouse → analytics).
- Provide transparent data quality metrics and engineered features ready for BI or ML experimentation.
- Offer a Streamlit dashboard and lightweight API to mimic how downstream teams consume the warehouse.

## What I DON'T DO
- Emulate raw KUKA telemetry firehoses, PLC protocols, or real-time robot control loops.
- Recreate advanced CAM simulation, collision detection, or generate executable robot code.
- Deliver machine learning models, predictive maintenance algorithms, or full production MLOps stacks.
- Handle enterprise deployment tasks (auth, orchestration, Terraform, HA clusters) beyond demo scope.
